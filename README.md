# Resnet-for-stock-market-prediction

A repository that demonstrates how to use a ResNet-based deep learning model to predict stock market trends.

## Overview

This project implements a ResNet (Residual Network) architecture tailored for stock market prediction. The model is designed to learn complex patterns in historical stock data and forecast future trends. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction scripts.

## Features

- **ResNet Implementation:** A customized ResNet architecture for time series data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts to clean, normalize, and prepare stock market data.
- **Model Training:** End-to-end training pipeline with adjustable hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation:** Tools to visualize and analyze the model performance.
- **Prediction:** A straightforward interface to predict future stock trends based on historical data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `pytorch`, `matplotlib`, etc.
